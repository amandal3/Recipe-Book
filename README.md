# Recipe-Book
This is my EE551 Engineering Python final project.

## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to have users experience new foods by allowing them to quickly search through a recipe book. The three situations where this program might come useful are: 
1. Often times, I might open my fridge and see a few ingredients but then have no idea what to make with them. With this program, I will be able to input these ingredients and have a couple of recipes pop up containing these ingredients (and more that I may need to purchase). 
2. Sometimes, I’m going to a party and there is a specific theme(specific culture or holiday) and I don’t know what to make and bring. This program will allow you to search for recipes based on a few select categories such as Christmas, Halloween, Vegetarian, Mediterranean, Chinese, Thai, Indian, American, Japanese, and Korean. 
3. Lastly, I might be adventerous one day and want to try and make something of a specific complexity level. This program will categorize complexity of the recipes based on how long it takes to make the meal, the number of ingredients needed for the meal and the number of steps in the recipe.

The recipes used will be generated by foodnetwork.com and allrecipes.com
