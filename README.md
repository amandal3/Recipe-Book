# Recipe-Book
This is my EE551 Engineering Python final project.

## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to have users experience new foods by allowing them to quickly search through a recipe book. Often times, I might open my fridge and see a few ingredients but then have no idea what to make with them. With this program, I will be able to input these ingredients and have a couple of recipes pop up containing these ingredients (and more that I may need to purchase). Sometimes, I’m going to a party and there is a specific theme(specific culture or holiday) and I don’t know what to make and bring. This program will allow you to search for recipes based on a few select categories such as Christmas, Halloween, Vegetarian, Mediterranean, Chinese, Thai, Indian, American, Japanese, and Korean.

The recipes used will be generated by foodnetwork.com and allrecipes.com
